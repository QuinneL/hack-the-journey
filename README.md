# Hack the Journey with Toto

## Overview of Toto


## Building Toto

Assumption


## Testing Toto

Once you've cloned Toto's directory, cd into that directory and run 
`python3 main.py`
After running the command, it will promt you for a profile json file and a trip 
json file. For testing purposes, just enter nothing when asked. We will 
provide the necessary example templates and grab critical information needed for our algorithm
from the json files.

Observe that we output a list of top recommended events for the user. The 
top recommended events list is created using the knapsack algorithm, which takes 
user's hobbies, time, and budget into consideration. 

We also output other recommendations that don't fit into user preferences and schedule as well
as top recommended events list.
